# About this project
TerraScan is a machine learning application designed to help farmers identify the type and quality of soil based on images, aiding them in making informed decisions about which crops to plant. This project leverages image classification to determine whether soil is fertile or not, and provides a detailed description of the soil type, helping farmers optimize their agricultural practices.

With the advancement of technology, traditional farming can benefit from precise tools that aid in identifying soil conditions. This project aims to bridge the gap in agricultural decision-making by providing a simple, reliable tool to classify soil from an image input. TerraScan helps to optimize crop growth by suggesting the best practices for different soil types.

This system is intended for farmers and agricultural enthusiasts who want to understand their soil conditions better and make informed decisions to improve their farming outcomes.

# Project Features
- **Soil Type Classification**: The system classifies soil into different types (fertile or not) based on an image input.
- **Soil Quality Assessment**: After identifying the soil type, the system provides a detailed description of the soilâ€™s fertility and optimal uses for different crops.
- **Simple User Interface**: A clean and easy-to-use interface built with Streamlit, where users can upload soil images and instantly get predictions along with descriptions.
- **Machine Learning Integration**: The application uses a pre-trained EfficientNet model fine-tuned on soil images to make predictions.
- **Future Improvements**: Future versions will include recommendations for specific crops based on soil type and additional support for real-time sensor data (if available).

# Technologies Used
- **TensorFlow**: For building the soil classification model.
- **Streamlit**: For developing the interactive web application.
- **Python**: Main programming language.
- **EfficientNet**: Pre-trained model used for classifying soil images.
